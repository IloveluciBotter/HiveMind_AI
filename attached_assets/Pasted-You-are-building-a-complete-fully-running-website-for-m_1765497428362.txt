You are building a complete, fully running website for my project “Train Your AI”.

This website is not the app itself.
It is a companion landing site that explains and showcases the project, and includes a small interactive demo that mimics the core idea.
The full app (the full AI training experience) exists separately but is directly related to everything on this site.

The site must:

Run end-to-end in this repl.

Have no placeholder text or TODOs.

Be fully responsive and pleasant to use on desktop and mobile.

Core concept to communicate

Train Your AI is:

An educational experience where users “train” a virtual AI brain by answering quizzes and learning themselves.

Less of an arcade game and more of an interactive learning lab:

Each session is a short quiz.

High scores mean the AI “accepts” the data and gets smarter.

Low scores mean the AI may roll back some intelligence to avoid bad training data.

There is also a crypto token called $BRAIN, used for gated access and future utility, but the focus is education, learning progress, and AI literacy—not financial speculation.

The website should:

Clearly explain the idea in simple language.

Let visitors try a small demo quiz on the webpage to feel how “training the AI” works.

Clearly state that:

“This is the official landing page for Train Your AI.”

“The full app lives separately but uses the same core training concepts.”

Overall vibe and style

Dark, futuristic learning lab theme.

Background: dark with subtle blue/purple gradient or glow.

Accent colors: neon cyan, soft purple, and a little green to represent learning/progress.

Tone: friendly, curious, educational. Not casino-like, not overly degen.

Use clear, conversational language. Avoid jargon wherever possible.

Page structure (single-page layout)

Build a single-page website with navigational links that scroll to sections:

Sections:

Sticky Header

Hero / Overview

“This Site vs. The Full App” clarification

“How It Works”

Interactive Lab (mini quiz demo)

“Why It’s Educational”

Token & Access (high-level, non-hype)

Cosmetics & Motivation

FAQ

Footer with About & Disclaimer

1. Sticky Header

At the top of the page, always visible while scrolling.

Left side: simple logo area:

A small brain/AI icon (e.g. emoji or simple graphic) and the text Train Your AI.

Right side: navigation links that scroll to sections:

“Overview”, “How It Works”, “Interactive Lab”, “Token”, “FAQ”.

Include a small button labeled Try the Lab that scrolls directly to the Interactive Lab section.

On small screens, the navigation should still be usable (e.g. simplified layout or stacked links).

2. Hero / Overview section

Big title:

“Train an AI brain by training your own.”

Subtext:

“Train Your AI is an educational lab where you answer focused quizzes and see how clean data shapes a virtual AI’s intelligence.”

Two primary actions:

Button: Try the Interactive Lab → scrolls to the Interactive Lab section.

Button: Follow on X → opens https://x.com in a new tab.

Under the buttons, a short row of feature tags, for example:

“Educational quizzes · Adaptive difficulty · AI personality · Token-gated features”

On the side (or below on mobile), show a simple visual:

A stylized “AI brain” or glowing orb with a small label like “Intelligence Level 3 → Level 4” to suggest progress.

3. “This Site vs. The Full App” section

This is important: clearly explain that this website is the landing/companion site, not the full app.

Small heading: “What this site is (and isn’t)”

Short paragraph explaining:

“This website is the official landing page for Train Your AI.”

“Here, you can learn what the project is about and try a small interactive demo.”

“The full Train Your AI app is a separate, more advanced experience that uses the same training system, more question content, wallet integration, and progression features.”

Include a note that the demo on this site “mirrors the core training loop” but is simpler than the full app.

4. “How It Works” section

Explain the core loop in 3–4 clear steps, focused on education:

Step 1: Answer focused quizzes

“You get a short set of questions around logic, general knowledge, and tech literacy.”

Step 2: Train the virtual AI

“High scores are treated as clean training data. The AI’s intelligence score increases.”

Step 3: Protect the AI from bad data

“If you score poorly, the AI may roll back some intelligence to avoid learning from noise.”

Step 4: Climb difficulty levels

“As you and the AI improve, the questions get more challenging.”

Present these as cards or numbered steps with icons.

5. Interactive Lab (mini quiz demo)

Build a small, self-contained interactive demo directly on this page:

A card titled “Interactive Training Lab (Demo)”.

Copy explaining:

“This is a simplified version of the training loop from the full app.”

“Answer a few questions and see how the demo AI’s intelligence score changes.”

Behavior:

Show a small “AI intelligence bar” or level display, such as:

“Demo AI Intelligence: Level 1 · Score: 0”

Below, provide a short quiz:

For example, 3–5 multiple-choice questions with real content (no placeholder questions).

When the user submits:

Calculate correct answers.

Show feedback:

“You scored X/Y.”

If they scored above a threshold:

Increase the demo AI’s “intelligence level” and update bar.

If they scored low:

Decrease or do not increase the intelligence, with text explaining that “bad data can’t always be used”.

This demo does not need to use any crypto or wallet logic; it just illustrates the educational concept.

The demo must be fully functional and resettable (e.g. a “Try again” button).

6. “Why It’s Educational” section

Explain the educational benefits in a friendly way:

Headline: “Why Train Your AI is an educational lab”

3–4 bullet points, for example:

“Makes AI training concepts tangible through quiz-based feedback.”

“Encourages deliberate practice and consistent improvement.”

“Shows how data quality affects model performance.”

“Gives learners a risk-free way to experiment with an ‘AI brain’.”

Include a short highlight box:

“You’re not just training a virtual AI. You’re training your own thinking.”

7. Token & Access section

High-level, educational, and safe. Do NOT make investment promises.

Title: “Where $BRAIN fits in”

Text that explains:

“$BRAIN is a token used in the full Train Your AI app for gated features like advanced training sessions and future experiments.”

“Holding a certain amount of $BRAIN may be required to access Ranked or higher-stakes training modes in the full app.”

“The focus of Train Your AI is educational and experimental—$BRAIN is a tool inside that ecosystem, not a promise of returns.”

Include a small disclaimer box:

“This is not financial advice. Train Your AI and $BRAIN are experimental and for educational/entertainment use only.”

You don’t need to show live token data; just explain the relationship conceptually.

8. Cosmetics & Motivation section

Explain the cosmetic/flair side as motivation, not power:

Title: “Cosmetics, styles, and motivation”

Explain:

“In the full app, you can earn a soft currency by performing well and use it to unlock cosmetic upgrades.”

“These include different AI ‘shells’ (like glitchy or overclocked cores) and neon auras.”

“Cosmetics are purely visual—they don’t increase intelligence or give gameplay power. They’re there to make progress feel satisfying.”

Display a visual grid or simple layout with a few example cosmetic concepts:

“Default Core”, “Glitched Core”, “Overclocked Core”

“Neon Blue Aura”, “Neon Purple Aura”, “Neon Green Aura”

9. FAQ section

Add a short FAQ with clear, honest answers. At least 5 Q&As. Example topics:

“Is this site the app?”

Answer clearly that this is the landing/educational companion site, with a demo, and that the full app lives separately but uses the same AI-training system.

“Do I need crypto to use Train Your AI?”

Clarify that the on-page demo does not require crypto, and that the full app uses tokens for certain modes.

“Is this financial advice?”

“No. This is an educational and experimental project.”

“Do you store my private keys or wallet info?”

“No. The full app uses standard wallet connections; private keys are never shared.”

“What kind of questions does the AI use?”

Briefly describe: logic, general knowledge, tech literacy, etc.

10. Footer: About & Disclaimer

In the footer, include:

A short About line:

“Train Your AI is an educational experiment that turns training an AI model into an interactive quiz experience.”

A disclaimer:

“Nothing on this site or in the Train Your AI ecosystem is financial advice.”

“The on-page demo stores its data only in your browser.”

A small link-style text:

“Follow on X” → again linking to https://x.com in a new tab.

General requirements

All visible text must be real, clear, and user-facing. No placeholder lorem ipsum or “add your text here”.

The page must be fully functional:

Navigation links scroll to sections.

Buttons work as described.

The Interactive Lab mini-quiz runs correctly and updates the demo AI’s displayed intelligence.

The site must clearly and explicitly state that:

It is the landing/companion site.

The full Train Your AI app is a separate experience but directly correlated to what’s described here.

Maintain a consistent dark, neon-accent learning-lab style throughout.

Build everything needed in this repl so that when I press Run, I get this full site immediately.
